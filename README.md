## Abstract
To utilize heat and electricity in a clean and integrated manner, a zero-carbon-emission micro Energy Internet (ZCE-MEI) architecture is proposed by incorporating non-supplementary fired compressed air energy storage (NSF-CAES) hub. A typical ZCE-MEI combining power distribution network (PDN) and district heating network (DHN) with NSF-CAES is considered in this paper. NSF-CAES hub is formulated to take the thermal dynamic and pressure behavior into account to enhance dispatch flexibility. A modified DistFlow model is utilized to allow several discrete and continuous reactive power compensators to maintain voltage quality of PDN. Optimal operation of the ZCE-MEI is firstly modeled as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). Several transformations and simplifications are taken to convert the problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) which can be effectively solved by CPLEX. A typical test system composed of a NSF-CAES hub, 33-bus PDN, and 8-node DHN is adopted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ZCE-MEI in terms of reducing operation cost and wind curtailment.
